## Abstract

This project analyzed a web-scraped database of technology jobs from 2023 for the purpose of isolating the top hard skills to learn for software engineering jobs today. The results showed that the most in-demand languages are not necessarily the highest paid, with python,  aws, and MongoDB being most common in high-paying software engineering, but  falling lower in rnaking when measured by frequency of demand and average salary for jobs requiring these skills. Based on the methology presented, it is recommended for budding siftware engineers to focus their education first on versatile scripting languages such as python, typescript, and javascript to maximize demand and financial compensation.

## Introduction

 I undertook this project not because I have the intention of pivoting into a software engineering role, but because the demand for such skills across various industries has notably grown in the last ten years, and is projected to stay on this trend with the diversification of consumer-facing maker technology. It stands to reason then that a valuable, versatile worker should have not only the skills niche to their subject area, but a preliminary understanding of programming for integration of new tools into software-agnostic industry pipelines. Summarily, an interdisciplinary approach to computer programming is more useful to collaborating teams, creates skill overlap and cost-efficient redundancy, and allows companies to keep up with ever-evolving sectors of their industry.

## Methodology
 -- using 2023 webscrape of technology jobs (datanerd.tech)
 The dataset used for this project was collected from 
 -- focus on remote Software Eng jobs
 -- programs used
 -- breakdown of each query (with 2.2 instead of 3)
 Four SQL queries were created for this analysis, accessible here: [project_sql_folder](/project_sql/). 

## Analysis
 -- results
 -- defining "best" and "optimal"

## Conclusion
 -- barriers to generalizing these results (niche and proficiency, geographical differences in demand and salary)
 -- alternative frameworks of 'best' analysis (matrix analysis, monthly trends, experience brackets)
 -- newer database (how to webscrape)
